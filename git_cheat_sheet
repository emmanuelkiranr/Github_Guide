>>Configure tooling 
 Configure user information for all local repositories

$ git config --global user.name "[name]"
    Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
$ git config --global user.email "[email address]" 
    Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
$ git config --global color.ui auto
    Enables helpful colorization of command line output

=>Create repositories 
   When starting out with a new repository, you only need to do it once; either locally,
   then push to GitHub, or by cloning an existing repository. 

$ git init 
   Turn an existing directory into a git repository
$ git clone [url] 
   Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the 
   files, branches, and commits

The .gitgnore file 
Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being tracked with Git. This is typically done in a special file named  .gitignore  . You can find helpful templates for  .gitignore files at github.com/github/gitignore.

=>Branches 
   Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any commits you make will be 
   made  on the branch you're currently “checked out” to. Use  git status  to see 
   which branch that is. 

$ git branch [branch-name] 
   Creates a new branch
$ git checkout [branch-name] 
   Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
$ git merge [branch]
   Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch. This is usually 
   done in pull requests, but is an important Git operation.
$ git branch -d [branch-name] 
   Deletes the specified branch

=>Synchronize changes 
   Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.com

$ git fetch 
   Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches
$ git merge 
   Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch
$ git push 
   Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
$ git pull
   Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the 
   corresponding remote branch on GitHub.   git pull  is a combination of   
   git fetch  and   git merge 

=>Make changes 
   Browse and inspect the evolution of project files

$ git log
   Lists version history for the current branch
$ git log --follow [file] 
   Lists version history for a file, including renames
$ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch] 
   Shows content differences between two branches
$ git show [commit] 
   Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit
$ git add [file] 
   Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]" 
   Records file snapshots permanently in version history

=>Redo commits 
   Erase mistakes and craft replacement history

$ git reset [commit] 
   Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally
$ git reset --hard [commit] 
   Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit

CAUTION! Changing history can have nasty side effects. If you need to change commits 
that exist on GitHub (the remote), proceed with caution. If you need help, reach out 
at github.community or contact support.
